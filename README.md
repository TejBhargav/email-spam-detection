Email Spam Detection

This project is an Email Spam Detection system that classifies emails as spam or ham (not spam) using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails to detect patterns and distinguish between spam and legitimate emails.

The project includes preprocessing of email text by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters. Feature extraction is performed using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Bag-of-Words. Various machine learning models such as Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest are used for classification. Performance evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The technologies used in this project include Python, scikit-learn, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visualization. To get started, ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed, clone the repository, and install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

To train the model, run python train.py. To test the model on new emails, use python predict.py --email "Your email text here". The dataset used for training consists of spam and ham emails, and publicly available datasets such as the SpamAssassin Dataset and Kaggle Email Spam Dataset can be used.

The model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Future enhancements include implementing deep learning models like LSTMs and Transformers, improving feature engineering with advanced NLP techniques, and developing a web-based interface for email classification.
